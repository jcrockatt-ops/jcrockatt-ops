# Hi, I’m Jason 👋
Exploring the intersection of **AI** and **marketing operations**.  
Currently experimenting with:
- 🎙️ Voice clones (ElevenLabs)
- 🎥 Video avatars (HeyGen)
- ⚡ Simple workflow automation (Make.com + Google Sheets)

## What I’m doing here
This is my **AI Generalist Playground**:
- Small, practical demos
- Notes on what worked (and what didn’t)
- A roadmap of experiments in automation and creative tech

## Goals
- Learn by building, even at hobbyist scale
- Document clearly for others (and for recruiters)
- Bridge creative marketing workflows with applied AI tools
